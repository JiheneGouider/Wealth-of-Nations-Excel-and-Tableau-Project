# Wealth of Nations Dataset Visualization Project üìä

Welcome to the Wealth of Nations Dataset Visualization Project! This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing different economic indicators from the Wealth of Nations dataset.

## Overview

In this project, I utilized the Wealth of Nations dataset to gain insights into the economic landscape of countries around the world. The dataset was cleaned, filtered, and sorted using Excel to ensure accurate analysis.

## Dataset Preparation

The Wealth of Nations dataset was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or errors, filtered to include only relevant data points, and sorted to identify the top 20 highest-ranking countries based on selected economic indicators.

## Visualization

Using the sorted dataset, I created visualizations to represent the economic data effectively. These visualizations include charts, graphs, and other graphical representations to showcase key insights and trends in the economic performance of the top 20 highest-ranking countries.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured data accuracy and consistency by cleaning the dataset in Excel.
- **Data Filtering:** Selected relevant data points and filtered out noise to focus on essential information.
- **Data Sorting:** Identified the top 20 highest-ranking countries based on economic indicators.
- **Chart Building:** Created visually appealing charts and graphs to visualize the economic data effectively.

**Create Macro Buttons** <br>
A Macro Button is a button that is inserted into a spreadsheet and has a macro code attached to it. The macro can be a record task that can occur, or the macro can be typed directly into the Visual Basic editor. When macro code is created (or the macro is recorded), it can then be assigned to a button or even a shape. Once assigned to one of these types of objects, a macro process can be repeated by clicking on the object that it is assigned to.<br>
‚Ä¢	Save Button<br>
The first step to create a save macro button is inserting the button itself. To start this task, click on insert in the menu tab. Then, choose the desired shape type.<br>
![image](https://github.com/JiheneGouider/Wealth-of-Nations-Excel-and-Tableau-Project/assets/168087527/8173ea92-8cfa-423e-88d1-942fa6517f81) <br>
In the worksheet, click where you want to insert the shape.
After creating the shape, right click on it and select edit text. Then, name it ‚Äúsave‚Äù.<br>

## Tableau-Task <br>
**Import data** <br>
‚Ä¢	To start, open a new workbook and select the "Connect to Data" option in the left-hand window. From here, a drop-down menu will open displaying a variety of data types that can be read in by Tableau. Click on the "Microsoft Excel" option.<br>
‚Ä¢	From here, find the excel file for the ‚ÄúWealth of Nations‚Äù database and click on Open once selected.<br>
 ![image](https://github.com/JiheneGouider/Wealth-of-Nations-Excel-and-Tableau-Project/assets/168087527/8414dc2d-0369-4337-b42c-46e4ffc83584) <br>

‚Ä¢	The Data Source page should open, displaying the available columns and a preview of the data. This page also lets you see the metadata of the file and allows you to do any data source filtering if desired. From here, we can use this data source to worksheets to analyse the data in creative ways.<br>
![image](https://github.com/JiheneGouider/Wealth-of-Nations-Excel-and-Tableau-Project/assets/168087527/7f64c59d-775f-4a08-98b2-0cc2ad829b61) <br>
	**Set relationships** <br>
We have three sheets and the common column for all of them is country, so the visual arrangement of the sheets does not matter only the columns that we use to create the relationship matters. 
We have to drag and drop the sheets and we can arrange them in a straight line as seen below.<br>
 ![image](https://github.com/JiheneGouider/Wealth-of-Nations-Excel-and-Tableau-Project/assets/168087527/56642b4b-e5d6-4ce6-b2ce-d7c2d8050f4c) <br>
	**Check data type** <br>
All fields in a data source have a data type. The data type reflects the kind of information stored in that field, for example: integers, dates, and strings. 
The data type of a field is identified in the data pane by one of the icons shown below. By clicking on it, data type will be displayed.<br>
 ![image](https://github.com/JiheneGouider/Wealth-of-Nations-Excel-and-Tableau-Project/assets/168087527/1aaed6a7-d38f-4cac-8353-2212b845ce33) <br>

**Build charts** <br>
Before starting to build our dashboard, we need to keep in mind that our client is colour blind and is only interested in top 20 highest ranking countries. <br>
‚Ä¢	First visualization: is a bar chart which shows the distribution of GDP for the top 20 counties. <br>
X-Axis: Countries listed from top to bottom based on their ranks.<br>
Y-Axis: GDP values <br>
Each country has its own bar, with the length indicating its GDP. The bars are typically arranged from the highest GDP at the top to the lowest at the bottom. 
This visualization allows for a quick comparison of the economic power of different countries. The top-ranked countries would have longer bars, indicating their larger GDPs, while lower-ranked countries would have shorter bars. This chart can help identify trends, such as which countries have the largest economies and how they compare to one another. <br>
![image](https://github.com/JiheneGouider/Wealth-of-Nations-Excel-and-Tableau-Project/assets/168087527/90882d84-ee1c-4c15-a22d-d8be25956acc) <br>

‚Ä¢	Second visualization: is a world map which displays the life expectancy for the top 20 counties. <br>
Different shades or colours on the map represent varying life expectancy values. Darker colours typically indicate higher life expectancy, while lighter shades indicate lower life expectancy. 
This visualization offers a visual representation of global health disparities and can be a valuable tool for understanding the factors that influence life expectancy across different countries and regions.<br>

‚Ä¢	Third visualization: is a bubble chart which compares the numbers of smartphone users for top 20 countries.
It‚Äôs a graphical representation where each country is represented by a bubble.
The size of each bubble represents the number of smartphone users in that country. Larger bubbles indicate a higher number of smartphone users, while smaller bubbles represent fewer users.
Each bubble is labelled by the name of the corresponding country.<br>

‚Ä¢	Fourth visualization: is a combination of a line chart and a bar chart 
By combining the bar chart and line chart, we can gain a richer understanding of the complex interplay between economic development and health outcomes across different countries.<br>

# Wealth of Nations Dataset Visualization Project üìä

Welcome to the Wealth of Nations Dataset Visualization Project! This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing different economic indicators from the Wealth of Nations dataset.

## Overview

In this project, I utilized the Wealth of Nations dataset to gain insights into the economic landscape of countries around the world. The dataset was cleaned, filtered, and sorted using Excel to ensure accurate analysis.

## Dataset Preparation

The Wealth of Nations dataset was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or errors, filtered to include only relevant data points, and sorted to identify the top 20 highest-ranking countries based on selected economic indicators.

## Visualization

Using the sorted dataset, I created visualizations to represent the economic data effectively. These visualizations include charts, graphs, and other graphical representations to showcase key insights and trends in the economic performance of the top 20 highest-ranking countries.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured data accuracy and consistency by cleaning the dataset in Excel.
- **Data Filtering:** Selected relevant data points and filtered out noise to focus on essential information.
- **Data Sorting:** Identified the top 20 highest-ranking countries based on economic indicators.
- **Chart Building:** Created visually appealing charts and graphs to visualize the economic data effectively.
